add writing support:
MPQ_FILE_REPLACEEXISTING sounds awesome.
open, getfilesize, allocate vector for handle, copy everything there, when off+bytes > size resize vector, write into buffer, repeat until flush or close, create with replace and sizeof buffer, write, close, repeat until closing mpq, flush, compress.

Ladik:
"> when off+bytes > size resize vector
Don‘t bother. StormLib will do that for you as long as you don’t
write more data than originally passed to SFileCreateFile.

Also, remember that if you rewrite a file inside a MPQ, there will be a hole
in the MPQ that is the remains of the original file before rewriting.
SFileCompactArchive fixes this problem, but that’s kinda hell slow function
that rebuilds the MPQ from scratch."
